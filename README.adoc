= rep

https://github.com/eraserhd/rep

A single-shot nREPL client designed for shell invocation.

This connects to a running nREPL server (like kind started with `lein repl`,
for example), sends some code to be evaluated, and prints the results and
output.

....
$ rep '(clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh)'
:reloading ()
:ok
....

Unlike other nREPL clients, `rep` does not try to maintain a persistent
connection, meaning that thread-local variables and bindings like `*e` and
`*1` will not persist across invocations of `rep`.  Perhaps there are
other limitations because of this?

== Installation

Download the latest Linux or MacOS binaries from the GitHub releases tab
above.

== Building with Graal

This is a somewhat graaling process right now, so bear with me.

You'll first need to install https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[GraalVM].

Graal currently (rc11) has some issues with some of the bytecode that Clojure
creates (see below), so we need to use a patched clojure and spec.alpha.  The
`.circleci/images/primary/build.sh` script will build and install these into
your local maven repository.  The script requires a
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[maven] install.

You will need at least, and possibly _exactly_, leiningen 2.8.3, due to how
it attempts to side-load nREPL.  It is available as `deps/lein`.

....
$ deps/lein native-image
....

You will find it in 'target/default+uberconf/rep'.

== Usage, Options, and Examples

See https://github.com/eraserhd/rep/blob/develop/rep.1.adoc[the rep manpage].

== Using with Kakoune

The `rc/` folder contains scripts which add a `,e` user mode to Kakoune.  To
link this to Kakoiune's autoload directory, do the following:

....
$ make install
....

`rep` must be in the path for the plugin to work.

== Graal/Bytecode Issues

At the moment, Graal doesn't deal well with the way Clojure generates bytecode
from its 'locking' macro, so to build bytecode that Graal can handle, we need
to apply https://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/attachment/18767/clj-1472-3.patch[this patch].
This issue is being tracked
https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1472[here] and
https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/861[here].
